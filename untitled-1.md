Silicon Valley \(murder\) mystery

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/41222/mechanism-roll-and-write

Goal

You are detectives tasked with solving a mystery and bring a villain to justice. Whoever scores the most points is declared the winner. You gain points for speed and accuracy in solving the mystery.

Setup

Choose a scenario. Each scenario consists of a number of clues. Each clue has a description, a zone that matches an area on the scenario pack map, and a type. A scenario suggests the levels of quality you should attach to each clue, but you can also adjust the level yourself to change game length, for example:

* 3 or less - Short game
* 5 to 7 - Medium game
* 7+ - Long game

All players roll a dice to determine which zone they begin in, they can pick which square in that zone.

_The map sheet has an overview of the location, there should be tiers of transport methods, i.e. certain streets and terrain take longer to cross, others are chokepoints etc._

The notebook sheet is a grid of clues and their “freshness”, meaning at the end of the game players score points for the number of clues they find and when \(the freshness\) they gain them\).

Determine the first player randomly.

Scenarios

All scenarios have a number of clues \(length dependent\), a number of clues that need to be found to finish the scenario, and for each clue a number of levels of freshness \(length dependent\), as players find clues, they get less useful, starting from basically giving it away, to a complete red herring.

Turns

Roll 1 six sided dice, you then decide whether you use it for. The options are.

Movement

If you opt to use the dice value for movement, you must move the exact number of squares.

Check for a clue

Consult the scenario to see if there’s one or more clues present in the region number that matches the dice roll.

Foresight/Research

Consult the scenario to see if there are clues available that match the type that matches the dice value.

Manipulate

Use the dice value to ruin/manipulate the investigation of another player.

This means that a player can opt to use the dice roll to move towards another clue, place clues where they need them, or make an existing clue an opponent is near of a lower value.

When a player reaches a clue, they read the clue in the scenario book, cross off the clue, and lower the value of the clue in that location.

We recommend you use vertical lines to indicate the current level of the clue, i.e. “\|” for level , “\|\|” for level 2 etc.

For indicating the current location \(and path\) of a player you can use initials, different colours, counters, or something else.

To gain a clue, you need to visit two locations matching the type of clue on the clue list. When you visit the second matching location, read the clue description, and mark the clue number and its current quality level on your notebook sheet, and reduce the quality by 1.

Turn order

Game end

The game ends when the first player reaches the number of clues defined by the scenario.

Scoring

The number of clues multiplied by the tier. So for example 3 level 3 clues are worth 9 points, 5 level 2 clues are worth ten points.

Each player should also explain what they think happened in the scenario, this is purely for fun, but you might want to consider rewarding bonus points for whoever is most accurate or has the best interpretation of clues.

Scenarios

* Rival to soylent green trials a new recipe and is found poisoned to death
* Industrial sabotage
* Kidnap…

_Length - Medium, 5 clues to complete_

### Locations and clues

**Region 3: The murder scene - Social**

André Lenhart, partner at San José venture capital firm MoarDollar attended a launch party hosted by a local game studio his company had invested in. At around 1am he was discovered face down in a ball pit on the rooftop terrace. Initially other party goers thought he was just passed out as he had been hitting the free punch quite hard. When he hadn’t moved an hour later, they called security, who found he was dead, with ball pit balls filling his throat. Was it an accident, or intentional?

  
**Region 1: GameStep studios - Office**

Some of the party goers remember a strangely dressed figure arriving late, walking right past the free food and drinks, and right up to the terrace. André had had a few drinks, but he was still quite sharp, other party goers remember him doing well in a game of “DanceStar” at 11pm.

**Region 5: MoarDollar offices - Office**

You speak with Andrés assistant. He always had a packed schedule from morning to night, and little time for much else in his life.

**Region 2: Andrés home - Residential**

You find the home of a typical busy Valley executive, sparse, but expensively decorated, and little sign of someone spending much time here. On the hallway table are a pile of unopened letters addressed to “my darling”.

**Region 3: Andrés boyfriends home - Residential**

Brendon looks surprised to meet you, and you notice a hastily dumped pile of clothing in the corner of his lounge room. He says he has not seen André in over a week, which was common as he was often so busy.

**Region 6: Andrés mother’s home - Residential**

Andrés mother is tearful as she greets you at the doorway. She explains that André had always prioritised work above life and relationships, and she knows that André and Brendone were having increasing heated arguments.

**Region 4: The Braized Avocado - Social**

The night before the party, staff remember André and Brendon eating at the restaurant, and at a certain point Brendon screamed extremely loudly, “I can’t take this anymore, you might as well be dead, the amount i see you!”, and stormed out of the restaurant.

Solution

This is a time-honoured tale of jaded lovers. Andrés boyfriend, Brendon Moncrieff had become resentful and jealous at the number of parties that Andreé attended for work and networking. Tonight he had begrudgingly let him attend this launch party, but gatecrashed in disguise, and drowned him in the ball pit at midnight in a fit of jealous rage.

## Tech Punch

_Length - Medium_

Asha Dahwan, cofounder of AirP&P, the AirBnB of cooling was found bludgeoned to death by a large blunt object in her office early this morning. In her calendar the day before was an appointment with the mysterious “X”. Who was X, did they kill her, and what was the murder weapon?

Solution

Asha was hit in the head by an award she recently won for her company from the Valley observer for being the “coolest” startup. She was beaten by one of the runner ups for the award, Gerald Sejate, CCO of Frigid, a dairy-sugar free ice cream startup. Gerald ran, and stole the award, he now has it proudly displayed over the fireplace in his apartment, the faintest spots of blood still underneath.

## Robo Justice

_Length - Short, 3 clues to complete_

### Locations and clues

**Region 3: Zachary’s apartment - Residential**

Zachary Pontolli, the founder of a buzzing pet grooming robotics startup, **Frr**, was found dead in his downtown apartment. He was strangled to death by a prototype dog walking robot he was testing. Or was he? It’s your job to find out…

**Region 4: The Frr offices - Office**

The first thing that catches your eye as you enter the offices are a series of robots that look like rapidly improving prototypes and posters proclaiming an “end to needing to hire dog walkers”.

**Region 5: A popular dog walking park - Civic**

You notice a handful of dogs wandering the park walked by a machine emblazoned with a giant “Wz”, they seem to occasionally malfunction.

**Region 4: The Walkeez offices - Office**

This large warehouse office combo is full of robots of different sizes and models, all fitted with retractable leashes, and in the reception of this warehouse office you notice a poster proclaiming “for when you don’t have time for your precious”.

**Region 6: A luxury holiday rental - Residential**

You find a woman attempting to hide in the bathroom, in the lounge room are three dogs barking loudly and running around the room with two “Wz” emblazoned robots whirring around after them

### Solution

Zachary was murdered by a rival CEO of **Walkeez**, Tasha Limoine. She was angry about **Frr** making a rival to their long established product and visited Zachary's apartment in a hope to convince him to work on a collaboration, instead of rivals. Zacahry was rude, accusing Jared of making an inferior product to their prototype, and was so arrogant it angered Jared. She used the lead typically attached to the prototype, and strangled Zachary, then hastily reprogrammed the robot to make it look like it had malfunctioned. In a panic she then hot footed to a holiday rental to hide until the heat died down.

Scenario idea:

Test-tube threats

A celebrity/influencer is selling her zygotes for ridiculously high prices, but her business is booming. She contacts you because she is getting more and more serious death threats. One threat is from a wife of a guy who previously, without the wife’s knowledge bought a zygote for the couple’s test-tube baby project, and replaced it with his own wife's. Another threat is from a conservative religious group. Another threat comes from the family of poor illegal immigrants, who, it turns out, the celebrity buys the zygotes she buys from. I don’t know how, but you could have the option to whistleblow her business after finding this clue, if you find it at the highest clue tier.

Concerns

* Is it a problem if players just place clues very quickly and then all they do is move around and screw with each other?
* Is the player who moves quickest always the most powerful?

Scratch ideas

* Spots need space for pre-printed type and a place to write the tier

Players take it turns to move along lines \(drawing as they go\) to get from their current location to their next location, every turn a player has x movement points and each path shows the movement cost per square.

BD Notes:

**Dice for movement**

The movement I think must also be tied to the size of the map. For example, we should set the largest distance you can go from the top of the map to the bottom, and a number of rounds it takes to cross it.

In pandemic, reign of cthulhu, the maximum distance to reach the other corner is 8-12 moves, depending on the route you take \(assuming no blocks on the path\), which can be covered in maximum 3 rounds \(if you don’t do anything else\).

In Concordia, the furthest areas from the starting zone \(in the middle\) are generally 5-6 routes away, which would take 3 movement actions \(using the settler card\) to reach \(in the beginning, but then it gets complicated\)

In Narcos, the longest route from top to bottom is 10 fields, and from left to right it’s 8 fields. With Airports for travel shortcuts \(and assuming no roadblocks\), it generally takes maximum 3-4 movements actions to go from a random point A to any other point B.

In Cartographers, the map is 11\*11 fields. You need at least 3 shapes to complete a horizontal/vertical line \(maybe 4, if you draw bad cards\).

In Horrified, the largest distance it’s worth to travel between opposite corners is 6-7 areas, and it takes 2 rounds to travel \(without character’s fast travel ability\)

In Periodic, on the abstract map of the periodic table, the longest distance is 18 areas, and you need to spend at least 3 energy actions to move anywhere you want.

In Newton \(just after browsing through the quick rules guide and an image of the map :\) \), the map corners seem 8-9 travel distances away.

So however large the map, I think it should take on average 2-3 movement actions to cross between locations.

So with a D6 \(avg. 3.5\), we need a map at least 11\*11 fields.

With a D8 \(avg. 4.5\) we need a map at least 14\*14 fields

With a D10 \(avg 5.5\), we need a map at least 17\*17 fields

With a D12 \(avg. 6.5\), we need a map at least 20\*20 fields

Given the A4 sheet size \(297\*210 mm\), and the need for space to draw on, based on this I think we should rule out using a D12 for movement. Maybe with chokepoints or roads that take more action points to travel, we can adjust on this.

Dice for points

I think if we want to give the players the ability to change the value of a location, we should have Tier 2 and 3 clues \(cold trails and weaker clues, we should give each other a name, like circumstantial evidence, red herrings or something\) have permanent modifiers \(Original value minus X, original value minus X+2\)

In case of

| Name | Tier 1 \(Hot clues\) | Tier 2 \(circumstantial evidence\) | Tier 3 \(Cold Trailer\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Value | Original value based on dice roll | Original value minus 1 | Original value minus 3 |
| D6 | Range: 1-6 \(Avg. 3.5\) | Range: 0-5 \(Avg. 2.5\) | Range: -2 - 3 \(Avg. 0.5\) |
| D8 | Range: 1-8 \(Avg: 4.5\) | Range: 0-7 \(Avg. 3.5\) | Range: -2 - 5 \(Avg 1.5\) |
| D10 | Range: 1-10 \(Avg. 5.5\) | Range: 0-9 \(Avg. 4.5\) | Range: -2 - 7 \(Avg. 2.5\) |
| D12 | Range: 1-12 \(Avg. 6.5\) | Range: 0-11 \(Avg. 5.5\) | Range: -2 - 9 \(Avg. 3.5\) |

LOL, changing into excel now:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZEtbyhWUL2g702ELEV\_NwnV2zARqlASMY5OJR7y0xA/edit?usp=sharing

So, after the dice calculations, I think we can just pick one die type, where the min-max-average points look sympathetic \(do we want a lot of points, or less?\), and scale the map for it.
